# BCG-RR Synchronization and Heart Rate Analysis

This project processes **Ballistocardiogram (BCG)** and **R-R interval (RR)** data to estimate heart rate, synchronize timestamps, and calculate errors between the two datasets. It includes signal processing, body movement detection, filtering, downsampling, and wavelet decomposition to extract meaningful insights.

## ‚ú® Features

‚úÖ **BCG and RR Data Synchronization**: Aligns timestamps and signals from BCG and RR datasets.  
‚úÖ **Body Movement Detection**: Removes segments of the BCG signal affected by body movements.  
‚úÖ **Signal Filtering**: Applies band-pass filtering to isolate heartbeat and breathing signals.  
‚úÖ **Downsampling**: Reduces the sampling frequency of the BCG signal to 50 Hz.  
‚úÖ **Wavelet Decomposition**: Decomposes the BCG signal into components for heartbeat analysis.  
‚úÖ **Heart Rate Estimation**: Computes heart rate from the processed BCG signal.  
‚úÖ **Error Calculation**: Compares BCG-derived heart rate with RR-derived heart rate and calculates errors.
